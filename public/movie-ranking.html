<h3>Ice Age</h3>
<p>This is my favourite animated film. The characters are drawn with exceptional detail.</p>
<h3>Good will hunting</h3>
<p>Sentimental movie that you can connect to.</p>
<h3>Star Wars</h3>
<p>For its time, one of, if not the greatest sci fi film. Very imaginative yet applicable setting.</p>
